        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Sofia Boada! </p>
        <p>I'm a senior at Boston University studying Computer Science. 
        I grew up in the Bay Area and spent 17 years there before moving to Denver, CO during the pandemic. 
        I am Colombian, and there is nothing I love more than visiting Colombia, which keeps me close to my roots—and yes, I speak Spanish! 
        I have always been passionate about languages, whether it is learning spoken languages or coding languages (been studying Mandarin for a few years!). 
        When I am not busy with school, you will usually find me watching or playing tennis, hitting the golf course, or skiing whenever I get the chance.</p>
